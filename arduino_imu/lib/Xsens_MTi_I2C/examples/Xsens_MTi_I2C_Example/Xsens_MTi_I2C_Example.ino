//This library demonstrates basic Xbus communication between an Arduino (Uno) and an Xsens MTi 1-series shield board (MTi-#-DK) using the I2C interface.

//At least the following hardware connections are required:
//MTi_SCL - Arduino_SCL
//MTi_SDA - Arduino_SDA
//MTi_GND - Arduino_GND
//MTi_3.3V - Arduino_3.3V
//MTi_DRDY - Arduino_D3
//Additionally, make sure to:
//  -Enable I2C by switching PSEL0,1 to "1"
//  -Supply the MTi-#-DK with 3.3V (since 5V will force USB mode)
//  -Add 2.7 kOhm pullup resistors to the SCL/SDA lines (only for MTi-#-DK board Rev 2.3 or older - newer revisions come with onboard pullup resistors)

//This example code is merely a starting point for code development. Its functionality can be extended by making use of the Xbus protocol.
//Xbus is the proprietary binary communication protocol that is supported by all Xsens MTi products, and it is fully documented at https://mtidocs.xsens.com/mt-low-level-communication-protocol-documentation

//For further details on this example code, please refer to BASE: https://base.xsens.com/s/article/Interfacing-the-MTi-1-series-DK-with-an-Arduino?language=en_US
