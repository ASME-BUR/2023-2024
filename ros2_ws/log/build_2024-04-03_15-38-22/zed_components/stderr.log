CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:129 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findnmea_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "nmea_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "nmea_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

    nmea_msgsConfig.cmake
    nmea_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "nmea_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "nmea_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "nmea_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
